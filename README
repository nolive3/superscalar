The included makefile has the following targets
all:
	same as procsim, but it is at the top
	so that just typing make works.
procsim:
	builds the simulator from source
	names the executable procsim
check:
	runs the simulator with each trace 
	storing the result in nick_res then 
	diffs each with the provided result 
	storing the difference in nick_res/errs.
	If any contain differences (they shouldnt)
	it immediately terminates similar to make 
	check from the previous assignment.
	Takes about a second per trace.
traces:
	This runs every possible configuration after 
	first running the relevant check and stores 
	the result to nick_full_res.
	This takes about 1~2 second per configuration 
	for a total of about 4~8 minutes per trace or 
	15~30 minutes total.
	This also generates 3.6GB of data.
	You probably dont want to run this one.
clean:
	This deletes generated files excluding the 
	full trace results.
distclean:
	This deletes all generated files.
